🍎🍌🍊 Smart Fruit Ripeness Grading System

A Computer Vision–Based Fruit Quality Classification System

This repository contains the Streamlit implementation of a Smart Fruit Ripeness Grading System, an AI-powered computer vision application developed for the BSD3513 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence – Group Project.

The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyse fruit images and automatically classify their ripeness into three intuitive grades:
Grade 1 (Unripe/Fresh), Grade 2 (Ripe), and Grade 3 (Overripe/Rotten).

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how computer vision can be applied to food quality assessment, supporting better decision-making in daily life such as consumption, storage, or disposal of fruits.

🔍 Application Features

In this application, you will find:

📷 Image-based fruit classification using computer vision

🍌🍎🍊 Support for banana, apple, and orange images

🧠 CNN-based prediction model trained on labelled fruit datasets

🎯 Grade-based output system:

🟢 Grade 1 – Unripe / Fresh

🟡 Grade 2 – Ripe

🔴 Grade 3 – Overripe / Rotten

📊 Prediction confidence visualisation for better interpretability

🖼️ Visual grade reference images to assist user understanding

🎨 Simple and user-friendly Streamlit interface

The system abstracts complex model predictions into easy-to-understand ripeness grades, making it suitable for non-technical users.

🧠 Methodology Overview

Fruit images are uploaded by the user

Images are processed and analysed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

The model predicts fine-grained fruit classes

Predicted classes are mapped into three ripeness grades

Results are displayed with confidence and visual references

This approach balances model accuracy, interpretability, and usability.

⚠️ Project Scope & Limitation

The system is designed only for banana, apple, and orange images

Predictions for other fruits may be unreliable

The model depends on visual features and lighting conditions

These limitations are typical and acceptable in machine learning–based systems.

🍽️ Closing Note

This project demonstrates the practical application of computer vision and deep learning in food quality assessment. By transforming raw image data into meaningful ripeness grades, the system highlights how AI can support everyday decision-making.
